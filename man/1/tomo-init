.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wm/logon
[
.B -l
] [
.BI "-u user"
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I tomo init
logs a user in to the Tomo el Fuego environment.
It is generally called from
.IR sh (1)
as the init program for the system
If no
.I user
name is specified by the
.B -u
option,
.I tomo-init
displays a login panel to prompt for one.
The user name must have a directory
.BI /usr/ user,
which will become the current directory.
(Otherwise,
.I logon
will display a diagnostic panel and prompt again.)
The user name is written to
.B /dev/user
(see
.IR cons (3)),
which is the name presented on subsequent attaches to file servers.
.PP
Normally,
.I logon
expects keyboard input to provide a name,
but if the
.B -l
option is given,
.I logon
displays a list of the names in
.BR /usr ,
allowing one to be selected using a mouse or touch screen.
.PP
Once the current directory has been set,
.I logon
creates a new name space for the user.
It then starts
.IR qwm (1)
to provide the initial application environment.
