.I /mnt/torrent
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Wm/torrent
is a Tk interface to the styx file system exported by
.IR torrentpeer (4).
It shows progress and the state of the transfer in various views.
The main view has two bars that show availability of pieces, locally
and distributed among the peers.  It has buttons for starting
and stopping the
.I torrent/peer 's
transfer, and a button that causes a new list of peers to be fetched
(`track').  Progress and state is shown by an estimated time of
arrival, number of bytes transferred and remaining, the current
download and upload rate, the number and kind of peers connected,
etc.  It also has text fields with the configured maximum data
exchange ratio, maximum bandwidth in both directions and maximum
total amount in both directions.  These values can be set by modifying
the value and pressing return.
.PP
The `files' view shows the file names in the torrent, their size
and their progress.  The `peers' view shows most relevant information
about connected peers:  their upload/download rates, total amount
of data transferred, their progress and their choked/interested
state, the number of requests both sides have scheduled, the age
of the connection, the `peer id' (which indicates which software
the peer is using) and the ip address and port of the connection.
The `badpeers' view lists peers that are currently not allowed to
connect, typically because they exhibited (potentially) malicious
behaviour.
.PP
The last three views, `torrentlog', `peerlog', and `errors' are
for debugging.  `Torrentlog' contains the lines read
from torrent/peer's
.I progress
file, `peerlog' the lines from the
.I peerevents
file, and errors only the errors.
.PP
All views are updated when a change is read from the
.I progress
or 
.I peerevents
file.  The main and peers view are refreshed every 3 seconds as
well.  After setting a configuration option, a new value is read from
torrent/peer.
