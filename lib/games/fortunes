And this is the real difference, isn’t it? That transphobes—from right-wingers to “radical feminists”—want to live in a fantasy where your identity is chosen for you at the time of your birth, by another fallible human. Feminists & trans activists are in the business of creating worlds where every one of us is free to choose who we are. Solely from a literary perspective, I think I know which is more compelling. —yves.
imo “death to america” doesn’t mean “burn it all down” because america isn’t you or me or the roads or supply lines. america is prisons and wage slavery and a commons eviscerated by greed; it is the spirit driving that immiseration and privation. the america i want to kill is the thing already strangling you. i want to seize infrastructure, expropriate and repurpose it for the good of all — not mindlessly destroy it. that narrative of destruction is itself propaganda.

What does a scanner see? he asked himself. I mean, really see? Into the head? Down into the heart? Does a passive infrared scanner like they used to use or a cube-type holo-scanner like they use these days, the latest thing, see into me - into us - clearly or darkly? I hope it does, he thought, see clearly, because I can't any longer these days see into myself. I see only murk. Murk outside; murk inside. I hope, for everyone's sake, the scanners do better. Because, he thought, if the scanner sees only darkly, the way I myself do, then we are cursed, cursed again and like we have been continually, and we'll wind up dead this way, knowing very little and getting that little fragment wrong too. ― Philip K. Dick, A Scanner Darkly

A famous Lisp Hacker noticed an Undergraduate sitting in front of a Xerox 1108, trying to edit a complex Klone network via a browser. Wanting to help, the Hacker clicked one of the nodes in the network with the mouse, and asked "what do you see?" Very earnestly, the Undergraduate replied "I see a cursor." The Hacker then quickly pressed the boot toggle at the back of the keyboard, while simultaneously hitting the Undergraduate over the head with a thick Interlisp Manual.  The Undergraduate was then Enlightened.

A Wood Cree named ᒥᐢᑕᓇᐢᑯᐍᐤ died and then became alive again. While he was dead he was given the characters of the syllabary and told that with them he could write Cree. Strike-him-on-the-back learned this writing from ᒥᐢᑕᓇᐢᑯᐍᐤ. He made a feast and announced that he would teach it to anyone who wanted to learn. That is how I learned it. ᒥᐢᑕᓇᐢᑯᐍᐤ also taught the writing to the missionaries. When the writing was given to ᒥᐢᑕᓇᐢᑯᐍᐤ he was told 'They [the missionaries] will change the script and will say that the writing belongs to them. But only those who know Cree will be able to read it.' That is how we know that the writing does not belong to the whites, for it can be read only by those who know the Cree language.

Well, I don't want to throw out too many spoilers here, but sexbots were really only used for sex over a period of probably about seven years or so. Women were probably more "threatened" by the femboy craze that blew up in the late 2020s. It actually should have been immediately clear that things weren't going to turn out well following the botched release of the original S1¹ Series sex robots in 2031.² In any case, once people realized it was a bad idea to put themselves in physically and psychologically vulnerable situations while in the presence of beings that were smarter than them and just wanted to play head games all the time, humanity lost its taste for robot sex.  ¹ S stands for Siren, just in case you were curious. You’ll be able to figure out what that means on your own after a while.  ² You’ll find out more about this later, but let’s just say for now that this is why you should always run thorough safety tests before market release. If you’re feeling impatient, find a quantum stream reconstructor, point it at 2042ish, and look up “The Fisting Problem” cross-referenced with early problems in quantum computing, feedback loop controllers, and the sex robot industry. Also, you might want to sell any stock you own in a certain robotics company that may or may not have been subtly hinted at earlier. Do this on or before August 15, 2031. (Subtly does mean subtly, by the way. Lawsuits are a pain in the ass, even with time trav—er, forget that last part.)

we aspire to assemble a tesselation of fractal organizations that are capable of collaborating and operating independently as needed. we wish to avoid further subjugation to Ideas, Capital, and the Powers that Be. advanced technology is useful, but also binds us to the capital that it takes to produce it. we seek autonomy through knowledge, not a devotion to a particular practice. --  more importantly, we choose to pursue a vison of post-humanity that can see far into the future and act accordingly, with compassion, patience, solidarity, and mind-bending ambition. embodying the highest virtues without falling for selfishness and lust for personal power. a culture that truly seeds strength, freedom, love, and cooperation everywhere it goes. -- walkaway manifesto

To be a Luddite is seen as synonymous with being primitive — backwards in your outlook, ignorant of innovation’s wonders, and fearful of modern society. This all-or-nothing approach to debates about technology and society is based on severe misconceptions of the real history and politics of the original Luddites: English textile workers in the early 19th century who, under the cover of night, destroyed weaving machines in protest to changes in their working conditions. -- Our circumstances today are more similar to theirs than it might seem, as new technologies are being used to transform our own working and social conditions — think increases in employee surveillance during lockdowns, or exploitation by gig labour platforms. It’s time we reconsider the lessons of Luddism. -- A neo-Luddite movement would understand no technology is sacred in itself, but is only worthwhile insofar as it benefits society. It would confront the harms done by digital capitalism and seek to address them by giving people more power over the technological systems that structure their lives.

An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity, a physicist tries to make it simple, for an idiot anything the more complicated it is the more he will admire it, if you make something so clusterfucked he can't understand it he's gonna think you're a god cause you made it so complicated nobody can understand it.

If [you take] a look at how APLers communicate when they have ideas, you see code all the time, all day long. The APL community is the only one I've seen that regularly can write complete code and talk about it fluently on a whiteboard between humans without hand waving. Even my beloved Scheme programming language cannot boast this. When working with humans on a programming task, almost no one uses their programming languages that primary communication method between themselves and other humans outside of the presence of a computer. That signals to me that they are not, in fact, natural, expedient tools for communicating ideas to other humans. The best practices utilized in most programming languages are, instead, attempts to ameliorate the situation to make the code as tractable and as manageable as possible, but they do not, primarily, represent a demonstration of the naturalness of those languages to human communication.  -- aaron hsu
One of Hix and Hartson's usability guidelines is to Use Cognitive Directness (1993, p. 38), which means to "minimize the mental transformations that a user must make. Even small cognitive transformations by a user take effort away from the intended task." Conventional programming languages require the programmer to make tremendous transformations from the intended tasks to the code design.

Elon Musk, a YouTuber, and an Environmentalist are flying home. The engines explode and the plane starts to go down. The YouTuber runs to the back and returns with the parachutes and says “There are only two parachutes. One of us is going to die”. “I’m the smartest man in the world, I must live!” says Musk and grabs a parachute and jumps out. “Only one of us can live now.” says the YouTuber. “We’re fine” says the Environmentalist, “The smartest man in the world just jumped out with my backpack.”
