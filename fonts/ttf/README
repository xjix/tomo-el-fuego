# ttf fonts

original sources for system fonts and big fonts that are more efficient to use
via font server.

## noto

tomo el fuego is designed to be accessible to all cultures. we use noto to help
facilitate that goal! the collection is very large, but it is important to have
native support for all forms of human expression via text. we recognize that
unicode does not yet provide support for many languages including maya.
